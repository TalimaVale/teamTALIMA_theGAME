# teamTALIMA: theGAME
Welcome to one of teamTALIMA’s project repos! We are an online, educational development community working on website, chat bot, and game development projects with our primary focus on game development.

## What is teamTALIMA: theGAME?
teamTALIMA: theGAME is an ongoing, open source, game development project. theGAME is an online multiplayer game set in an open world environment with RPG/adventure genre attributes. It is inspired from MMOs such as World of Warcraft and Guild Wars 2, adventure games such as The Legend of Zelda series, and open world games such as Skyrim and Minecraft (sandbox genre).

> *Note:* While always an online multiplayer game, there are no plans to expand into a full MMO architecture.

theGAME is being developed by teamTALIMA community members as a learning project. Primary development tools include Unity3D, C#, and Photon Framework (handles network code). This repo is managed by Talima (community founder) and our Project Managers, but project contributions can be made by anyone interested in improving their game development skills and/or helping us to improve the project!

This is an ongoing community project! It will never be ‘finished’, and having a few mismatched art assets and random features from teammates still learning and experimenting with game development, just makes our game that much more awesome ;)

## Can I play theGAME?
Yes! Check out the repo ‘releases’ page to download the latest build.

## Can I contribute to theGAME project?
Yes! Anyone can contribute to theGAME project. For project updates and discussion, we suggest that you join the teamTALIMA [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/dGFQ5tE "teamTALIMA's Discord Server") or try to catch a teamTALIMA [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/teamtalima "teamTALIMA's Twitch Channel") (where we develop the project live), but neither is strictly necessary.

We encourage anyone interested in learning more about game development to ‘Watch’ this project on GitHub and join the teamTALIMA community! Everyone from hobbyists to students to professionals to experts are welcome in here. We have many teammates within our community who mentor and do their best to answer questions and share knowledge about their development fields and areas of experience.

## This is Awesome! How do I contribute?
All contributions should be made through this repo. Create a ‘Pull Request’ with your contribution and description of contribution, and it will be reviewed by one of our project managers! Pull requests should contain as few changes as possible (only those necessary to implement the single, new feature the pull request is contributing) in order to avoid conflicts when merging into the project.

> *Note:* Most pull requests will need to be critiqued/revised slightly to merge with the project properly. This is standard. Do not be discouraged if your contribution is not accepted immediately.

Depending on the type of contribution, here are some guidelines to follow so your PR has the best chance of being merged:

### Programming
When contributing new code or code updates, each pull request should only deal with one game feature/bug fix. Be as focused with your changes as is reasonable, so the project code and your code will run into as few merge conflicts as possible.

Since this is a community learning project, code commenting is important to us. Any code which falls around an intermediate or higher tutorial level, needs to be commented. Use your best judgement.

In the description, state the new feature/bug fix to be implemented, and then describe your new code clearly and concisely.

Bonus points to contributors who take the time to match their code style to the project’s code style, so Project Managers do not have to focus on code maintenance/consistency :)

### Art Assets
When contributing art assets (3D models, 2D Sprites, textures, animations, etc.), each pull request should only deal with one asset and its dependencies. The exception to this is if you are submitting a collection or set of assets, then it is reasonable to submit the entire collection at once if desired.

> *Note:* Please clearly name all assets, and keep in mind that low-poly assets will result in better game performance. Use your best judgement.

There is a specific folder in our project for new asset contributions. Look for theGAME > _NewAssets > YourGitHubUsername. Create the ‘YourGitHubUsername’ folder and submit all your art contributions within it. An example of final folder structure: theGAME > _NewAssets > teamTALIMA > [all my new assets]

> *Note:* If you are submitting an asset which must be placed somewhere specific (like the Unity Resources folder), that is acceptable. You may want to note it in the PR description.

theGAME’s art style is fluid, and art assets will rarely be rejected on the basis of not conforming closely enough to the current visuals. Be creative! We want to see what you can do.

That being said, a collection of ‘concept art’ (screenshots of other games) pieces which our art style is derived from can be found here: [Concept Art Styles](../master/ConceptArtStyles.md)

If you are looking for inspiration in choosing an object to contribute, a list of currently desired art assets can be found here: [List of Desired Art Assets](../master/DesiredArtAssets.md)

### Sound Assets
When contributing sound assets, each pull request should only deal with one asset. The exception to this is if you are submitting a collection or set of assets, then it is reasonable to submit the entire collection at once if desired.

> *Note:* Please clearly name all assets. Use your best judgement.

There is a specific folder in our project for new asset contributions. Look for theGAME > _NewAssets > YourGitHubUsername. Create the ‘YourGitHubUsername’ folder and submit all your sound contributions within it. An example of final folder structure: theGAME > _NewAssets > teamTALIMA > [all my new assets] 

> *Note:* If you are submitting an asset which must be placed somewhere specific (like the Unity Resources folder), that is acceptable. You may want to note it in the PR description.

If you are looking for inspiration in choosing a sound to contribute, a list of currently desired sound assets can be found here: [List of Desired Sound Assets](../master/DesiredSoundAssets.md)

### Playtesting
Interested in playing or hacking theGAME in an effort to improve the project? Please submit any bugs you find as an Issue. 

Each bug should be represented as an individual Issue, and should contain details on the bug itself, where to find the bug, and ESPECIALLY how to replicate it.

### New Feature Ideas
Currently, all ‘ideas’ for theGAME should be submitted as an Issue with the label ‘idea’ attached to it. Any ideas or suggestions for new game features or improvements to the development process are always welcome!
